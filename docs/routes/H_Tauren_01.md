## Candidate ratios

Value = quest XP at the simulated level + mob XP + strategic bonus. Ratio = chain value / isolated time;
marginal ratio uses the detour from places the route visits anyway. A quest is dropped when both ratios are
below 0.35 × the median ratio, or when an objective is more than 900 yd from every hub.

yards from the previous task (blank after a flight, boat or zone change). Returns: the task is within
150 yd of an earlier task after the route went more than 600 yd away from it.

## Qualité

Checks of the itinerary (see `tools/routebuilder/quality.lua`): avoidable revisits (a place left,
then returned to only for accepts or turn-ins possible on the earlier visit), missed pickups
(within 40 yd), missed passing turn-ins (within 60 yd) and split objective areas (within 120 yd).
A place counts as left when the route went more than 150 yd away (220 yd for an objective area).
Reason: why the ordering kept it: `log cap`, `level` or `chain` (a constraint later in the route),
`free` (no constraint: a defect).

| Check | Count |
|---|---|
| Avoidable revisits | 0 |
| Missed pickups | 0 |
| Split areas | 0 |
| Missed passing turn-ins | 0 |

## Logistics

None.

## Warnings
